### Distribution:

Where are they. 

### Abundance:

How many?.

### As ecologist: The map of our dreams

# Conting Animals

#### Easy for animals that are conspicuous and that group together.

# Conting Animals

#### Not so easy if they don't group. Capture - Mark - Recapture. Distance

# Conting Animals

![Obtener densidad](img/Moose-capture_011.jpg)

#### For some species it is cumbersome, impractical and very expensive.

---

### Relative abundance

![:scale 80%](img/bird_abundance.jpg)

#### An indicator variable of the state of the population 

I don't know how many there are, but I do know where there are more and where there are less.

# However...

Biologist are not super heroes. We make mistakes!

#### Detectability and Imperfect detection concept

---

# Detectability depends of

--

## 1. Sampling conditions (weather, time).

--

## 2. The ability of the observer (sensor).

--

## 3. The biology of the species being sampled.

--

### This error should be considered carefully to avoid bias in abundance estimates.

---

# How the detection error occurs (Guillera‐Arroita 2016)

see ppt ![:scale 70%](img/detection.png)

##### It is an important error that must be considered in the sampling design!!!

Mackenzie popularizes occupancy $(\psi)$ as a proxy of abundance taking into account detectability  $(p)$



---

## Allows you to set goals and to monitor them over time.

![meta](img/meta.png)

class: inverse, middle, center

## Occupancy 
# $$\psi$$

## Detection probability 

# $$p$$

### Occupancy is a reflection of other important population parameters such as density.


---



## 1.  $(\psi)$ is the proportion of the sampled area that is occupied by the species.


## 2.  By visiting the site several times I can be more sure that I detect the species when it is found in that place.


## 3.  **Repeated sampling** are key.


## $(\psi)$ It is influenced by environmental variables (**Covariables**) such as vegetation cover, altitude, precipitation, etc.



---

# This is what a data table with repeated sampling should look like



```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
muestreo<-c("visit1","visit2", "visit3", "visit4")
Sitio<-c("site1", "site2", "site3", "sitex")
mat<-matrix(c(1,0,1,0,
              0,0,1,0,
              0,0,0,0,
              1,0,0,0),nrow=4,ncol = 4)
colnames(mat)<-muestreo
rownames(mat)<-Sitio
kable(mat,booktabs=TRUE,longtable=TRUE)
```

# Example calculating $\psi$ and $p$

### Frequentist method (Maximum likelihood)

.pull-left[   
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
muestreo<-c("v 1","v 2", "v 3", "v 4")
Sitio<-c("s 1", "s 2", "s 3", "s x")
mat<-matrix(c(1,0,1,0,
              0,0,1,0,
              0,0,0,0,
              1,0,0,0),nrow=4,ncol = 4)
colnames(mat)<-muestreo
rownames(mat)<-Sitio
kable(mat,booktabs=TRUE)
```
]

.pull-right[

| **Detection History**                  |
|----------------------------------------|
|  $H_{1} \psi$ × p1(1-p2)(1-p3)p4             |
|  $H_{2} \psi$ × (1-p2)(1-p2)(1-p3)(1-p4)p4 |
|  $H_{3} \psi$ × p1p2(1-p3)(1-p4)             |
|  $H_{4} \psi$ × (1-p2)(1-p2)(1-p3)(1-p4)p4 |

]


### Histories Combined in a Model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
L(\psi, p \mid H_{1},...,H_{x}) =  \prod_{i=1}^{x} Pr (H_{i})
\end{aligned}
$$
--

The model admits incorporating covariates to explain $\psi$ and $p$

# Same example calculating $\psi$ and $p$

### Bayesian method

.pull-left[   
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
muestreo<-c("v 1","v 2", "v 3", "v 4")
Sitio<-c("s 1", "s 2", "s 3", "s x")
mat<-matrix(c(1,0,1,0,
              0,0,1,0,
              0,0,0,0,
              1,0,0,0),nrow=4,ncol = 4)
colnames(mat)<-muestreo
rownames(mat)<-Sitio
kable(mat,booktabs=TRUE)
```

It is important to understand that there are two processes that can be modeled hierarchically

- The ecological process ($\psi$) follows a Bernoulli distribution.
- The observation model ($p$) follows a Bernoulli distribution.

The probability of observing the species given that it is present:

$p = Pr(y_{i}=1 \mid z_{i}=1)$

The Occupancy probability: $\psi =Pr(z_{i}=1)$

### A hierarchical (Bayesian) model

![Full Occu Bayes](img/Occu_Bayes.png)

### Admits Covariates


---

## Which one should I use? The maximum likelihood or Bayesian?

.pull-left[ 
ML

- Package [unmarked](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/unmarked/index.html)
- In R
- Admits "automatic" model selection AIC
- Problems with many NAs
- Hesian problem. estimates ok.
- Difficulty from 1 to 10: 3 if you already know R.

]

Bayesian

.pull-right[
- BUGS or Stan language, called from R
- Model selection is not that easy, BIC is not suitable 
- You don't have as many problems with many NAs in the matrix
- Estimates are more accurate.
- Difficulty from 1 to 10: 7 if you already know R.
